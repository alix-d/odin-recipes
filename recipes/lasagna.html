		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>2 (6.5 oz) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
			<li>2 (6 oz) cans tomato paste</li>
			<li>0.5 cup water</li>
			<li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
			<li>4 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
			<li>1.5 dried basil leaves</li>
			<li>1.5 tsp, divided, or to taste</li>
			<li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
			<li>0.5 tsp fennel seeds</li>
			<li>0.5 tsp ground black pepper</li>
			<li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
			<li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>0.75 lb mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
			<li>0.75 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
				over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes,
				tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2
				tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning,
				fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2
				hours, stirring occasionally.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
				lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
				noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine
				ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and
				1/2 teaspoon salt.

				To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
				9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
				sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with
				1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce
				over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
				Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
				cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
				with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the
				cheese.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
				bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes
				before serving.
